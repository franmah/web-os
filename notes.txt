- Refactor
  - window options/state is too big, try to break it down (maybe into multiple states?).
  - Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed
  - put types in their own folder
  
- Opening a youtube process should open it with window


// TODO in another branch

- Fix context menu bug (clicking on new folder doesn't hide menu)
  - I think there's a bug because a unique process id is generate now. There should be some process that don't have a unique id.

- Look into moving <style> with animations to metadata (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#document_metadata) and loading all animation in the same tag. If it's goog practice
  
- Look at next's documentation (like react)

- Use semantic html tags instead of div wherever possible + USE FRAGMENT wherever possible
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  
- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - Fix the z-index madness
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window

- Finish performance improved new Desktop item component (memo). AS WELL AS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS (useMemo, memo and useCallback)
  - window header should be memo()
  - try useCallback without memo's second argument (areItemsSame)

- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
