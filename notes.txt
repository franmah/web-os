/* TODO:

- Maximize button
  - show special menu when hovered after a while. (let's you side maximize it)
  - apply special menu effect when selected

- Make sure style matches windows 11

- Refactor
  - window options/state is too big, try to break it down (maybe into multiple states?).
  - Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed
  - put types in their own folder

  -- You should be able to open the same process multiple times unless it's set to unique


// TODO in another branch
-- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window

- Finish performance improved new Desktop item component (memo). AS WELL AS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS (useMemo, memo and useCallback)
  - try useCallback without memo's second argument (areItemsSame)

- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
