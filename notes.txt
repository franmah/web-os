/* TODO:

Fix the passing of window options and header options
- change shadow box and header text color when window is selected
- Fix <HeaderComponent.../> error in window.tsx
- try useRef for better performance


- Add animation: on Maximize/restore
- Maximize button
  - show special menu when hovered after a while. (let's you side maximize it)
  - apply special menu effect when selected

- Make sure style matches windows 11

- Refactor
  - Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed
  - put types in their own folder


// TODO in anothe branch
-- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window

    
- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
