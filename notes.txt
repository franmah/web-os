// WORKING ON

- move away from <table>
- file-view should take as much space as possible

EXPLORER
- create a context for the path?
- move colors and other css values into a constant file


/////////////////// PATH TO MVP ///////////////
1. Explorer app
  - side menu
  - show path in the top
  - previous/next
  - search
  - can select files
  - can open files
  - can create files

1.5 
EXTENSIONS they have to work!!
and change file system to use actual FS style (use string path instead of ExplorerItem)
2. Apps

- can open youtube and txt files
- can save txt files.

3. Taskbar
- show open app
- pin Apps
- slide icons

4. Windows menu
- show apps 


////// IN PROGRESS:

=> Using extensions
  - add icons
  - Updates ExplorerFile to have an extension
  - ItemsContainerComponent should let DesktopComponent know that there's a new file or folder that was created.

/////// TODO: in other


- explore idea of window manager having a windowFocused state.
    - Since only one window can be focused at a time

- Finish looking at react documentation.

- Look at next's documentation

- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - Fix the z-index madness (if possible)
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window
  - use consts as much as possible
      - color for window header text and buttons should be the setMaximizeMenuListeners
      
- Try to replace calls to getElementById to useRefs 
- add tests. Especially for services

- move to webstorm

- Bug: desktop image doesn't load right away. Maybe the background image should be it's own process?
  - also need a loading screen while starting processes load.
  The loading animation leaves the screen once everything is loaded.

- Use convention name for event listeners and event listener handlers passed as prop https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events:
  - Rename event function by handle... 
  - when passed as props it should be named onSomething...
  - rename event to 'e', example: onClick={e => doSomething(e)}. Don't rename it in the function, example: const doSomething(event) => ...
  - Add e.preventDefault(). This will avoid side effect such as triggering a new render when clicking a page. (make sure to test after doing so)

- look into using classes for services and having indepency injection

- Add option to have no window header (still should have minimize... icons)
  - Decide if there is a header of if the header accept children? Maybe accepting children would be easier. but how do they communicate with the process?
  - If no header then just reuse Component for icons
  - Nothing should go behind or over the icons

- file system
  - readdir should return a list of string. The deskop component should then transform those strings in DesktopItems using the files' extension

//////
Requirement for Notepad:
    - should open files with text
    - should save text
    - can be opened by textEditor but show loss of format error message popup

    - header
      - icon
      - multiple pages
      - add page buttons

      - (text in) pages are independent
      
    - second header
      - File, edit, view buttons
      - settings page and icon

    - Settings page
