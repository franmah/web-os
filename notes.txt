- Use the code in processRendererComponent to create a window Manager. The window manager should only pass a starting position to the window for now.
- BUG: Fix error message in processRendererComponent for windowsParams

// TODO in another branch

- Look into moving <style> with animations to metadata (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#document_metadata) and loading all animation in the same tag. If it's goog practice
  
- Look at next's documentation (like react)

- Use semantic html tags instead of div wherever possible + USE FRAGMENT wherever possible
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  
- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - Fix the z-index madness
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window

- Finish performance improved new Desktop item component (memo). AS WELL AS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS (useMemo, memo and useCallback)
  - window header should be memo()
  - try useCallback without memo's second argument (areItemsSame)

- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
