/* TODO:

- Make header it's own component + add icons to top right
  - if window is side maximized, then moving it should restore it's original size.
  - resizing and reaching top shoudle set height to max
  - if window is side maximized, then moving to the side should slid the window and still be considered size maximized (don't do if too hard)
  - scroll cursor should not show when window is maximized.
  
- Fix error and warning messages in console.

- resizing:
  - keep cursor changed while resizing even if going out of window
- change shadow box when window is selected
- Fix <HeaderComponent.../> error in window.tsx
- try useRef for better performance

- BIG CHANGE: 
  SHOULD ASK REDDIT FIRST
  ONLY FUNCTION THAT CHANGE STATE SHOULD BE IN HOOK (closeWindow shouldn't be for example)
  move useState into its own hook. Create functions called by children components instead of 
  changing the state directly LIKE useProcessContextState

- Decide whether to differentiate a click from a double click.

- put types in their own folder
- organize window service into multiple services if needed
- Make sure style matches windows 11
- Add animation: on Maximize/restore
- Add animation when moving window and mouse reaches side (and maximize)
- Maximze button should show special menu when hovered after a while. (let's you side maximize it)
- IF TIME: Find a way to show context info when hovergin something for a while (a reusable component or something.

    
- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)

- Eventually I'll need a WindowManagerSystemProcess that know where windows are in case I want 
to resize when window hits left/right and user wants anoter window to take the rest of the space
