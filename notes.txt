- Finish looking at react documentation.

- Look at next's documentation
  
- Use semantic html tags instead of div wherever possible + USE FRAGMENT wherever possible to reduce nujmber of container divs
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
  - Lists should use <ul><li><ul/> wherever possible (only if they're in a div, not if they're in a Fragment)

- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - Fix the z-index madness (if possible)
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window
  - use consts as much as possible
      - color for window header text and buttons should be the setMaximizeMenuListeners
      
- Try to replace calls to getElementById to useRefs 
- add tests. Especially for services

- move to webstorm

- Bug: desktop image doesn't load right away. Maybe the background image should be it's own process?
  - also need a loading screen while starting processes load.
  The loading animation leaves the screen once everything is loaded.

- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)


- Folders on desktop should be like windows (meaning have their own move state)

- Use convention name for event listeners and event listener handlers passed as prop https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events:
  - Rename event function by handle... 
  - when passed as props it should be named onSomething...
  - rename event to 'e', example: onClick={e => doSomething(e)}. Don't rename it in the function, example: const doSomething(event) => ...
  - Add e.preventDefault(). This will avoid side effect such as triggering a new render when clicking a page. (make sure to test after doing so)

- look into using classes for services and having indepency injection
