/* TODO:
- resizing:
  - keep cursor changed while resizing even if going out of window
  - try to move border component outside of window component (see how close, maximize icon reach the top of the window, 
      theres' not extra border layer) 
- Make header it's own component + add icons to top right
  - restore down: VscChromeRestore
  - maximize: VscChromeMaximize
  - minimize: FaRegWindowMinimize
  - maximize/restore should work + animation?
  - maximize/restore should show special menu if click hover icon for a few seconds
  - close should work
- IF TIME: Find a way to show context info when hovergin something for a while (a reusable component or something.)
- Window should size maxmize when hitting top, bottom, left or right of root window element
- put types in their own folder
- try useRef for better performance
- Make sure style matches windows 11
- change shadow box when window is selected
- Fix <HeaderComponent.../> error in window.tsx
- Minimize should be done later
- BIG CHANGE: ONLY FUNCTION THAT CHANGE STATE SHOULD BE IN HOOK (closeWindow shouldn't be for example)
  move useState into its own hook. Create functions called by children components instead of 
  changing the state directly LIKE useProcessContextState
    

- Fix error and warning messages.
- Eventually I'll need a WindowManagerSystemProcess that know where windows are in case I want 
to resize when window hits left/right and user wants anoter window to take the rest of the space
