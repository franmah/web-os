/* TODO:

- resizing:
  - resizing area should be outside of window
  - keep cursor changed while resizing even if going out of window

- change shadow box when window is selected
- Fix <HeaderComponent.../> error in window.tsx
- try useRef for better performance

- Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed

- put types in their own folder

- Add animation: on Maximize/restore
- Add animation when moving window and mouse reaches side (and maximize)
- Maximze button should show special menu when hovered after a while. (let's you side maximize it)

- Make sure style matches windows 11
- IF TIME: Find a way to show context info when hovergin something for a while (a reusable component or something.

    
- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)

- Eventually I'll need a WindowManagerSystemProcess that know where windows are in case I want 
to resize when window hits left/right and user wants anoter window to take the rest of the space
