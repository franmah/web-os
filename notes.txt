/* TODO:

- Header keeps rendering because headerId is different on every render

- Maximize button
  - Fix modal diseapring when mouse hover out of window (but not out of modal)

- header icons should be smaller (and fix maximize options div if needed)
- check what hover does on unselected windows (does it show maximize menu options?)
- Make sure style matches windows 11

- Refactor
  - window options/state is too big, try to break it down (maybe into multiple states?).
  - Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed
  - put types in their own folder


// TODO in another branch
-- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window

- Finish performance improved new Desktop item component (memo). AS WELL AS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COMPONENTS (useMemo, memo and useCallback)
  - window header should be memo()
  - try useCallback without memo's second argument (areItemsSame)

- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
