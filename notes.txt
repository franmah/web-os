/* TODO:

- try useRef for better performance 
    Message :
        // TODO: event listener on mouseup and mousemove are very inefficient because
        // they set the state every time (needed in order to get most updated state)
        // But that means the component renders on every mousemove/mouseup
        // maybe useRef instead of useState? (not for every field though)


- Add animation: on Maximize/restore
- Maximize button
  - show special menu when hovered after a while. (let's you side maximize it)
  - apply special menu effect when selected

- Make sure style matches windows 11

- Refactor
  - window options/state is too big, try to break it down (maybe into multiple states?).
  - Refactor code into services. And organize window service into multiple services if needed
  - put types in their own folder

  -- You should be able to open the same process multiple times unless it's set to unique


// TODO in another branch
-- Change to styled components so that variables are not defined multiple times
  - (update to fit styled components) window border radius size should be a global style and applied to header, hello and window


- Minimize should be done later (needs shortcut bar to work)
  could be done either hiding window or tell processLoader not to render because it's minimized (add minimize function to useProcessContextState)
